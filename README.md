- 👋 Hi, I’m @KateTheMikuFan
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, such as Colorful Stage, Spyro the Dragon and Kirby games! I also love Hatsune Miku!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on how to program a wide range of video games, such as puzzle games (i.e Tetris), 2D sidescroller platformers (akin to Super Mario Bros), and of course JRPGs!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making games with other like-minded people. 
- 📫 How to reach me? You can reach me on Git Hub! I also have a work email you can contact me with: katecalvert14@yahoo.com!
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that I like the Japanese culture, such as anime?
